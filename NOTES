Game is a simple 100x100 matrix
One square = 1 step
Game loop time is configurable
Each player has up to "game loop time" to submit action else they are assumed to be continuing in the same direction
Maybe provide accelaration when close to another player +2 instead of +1
When moto crash, all colored squared from this moto disapear
